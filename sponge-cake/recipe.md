STEP 1 : Whip 4 eggs then add 1.5 cups powdered sugar  (or 1 cup of granulated sugar) in thirds while continuing to whip.
STEP 2 : Preheat oven to 170C with the rack in the middle. You can brush room temperature butter on the inside of the pan, then dust it with flour, knocking out the excess to make the surface non-stick.
STEP 3 : While the eggs are whipping sift the 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 tsp baking powder, twice.
STEP 4 : Combine the melted butter and hot water in a cup and whisk together to mix.
STEP 5 : Whip the eggs and sugar for about 15-20 minutes. You want to make sure the eggs are properly whipped before continuing with the next steps for the successful rise of the cake in the oven.
STEP 6 : Add 1 Tbsp of vanilla extract. This step is optional but I recommend.
STEP 7 : Now add the flour into the whipped eggs in halves, carefully folding with a spatula forming the number 8 with each stroke. Do not overfold or the cake will be tough. Just fold enough to mix the flour.
STEP 8 : Add the melted butter mixture into the batter and carefully fold with a spatula until no streaks of liquid are seen.
STEP 9 : Pour the batter into the greaced pan.
STEP 10 : Bake the cake for about 30 minutes on the middle rack of preheated to 170C oven. Check the cake with a toothpick/skewer by inserting it in the middle. If it comes out clean with no crumbs on it, the cake is ready to be removed from the oven. Remove it to a cooling rack and allow to sit undisturbed for 5-10 minutes. 
STEP 11 : Then invert it onto a cooling rack and remove the foil. Allow to completely cool before using.
STEP 12 : Eat till you are full and do not forget enjoy!!!!!
